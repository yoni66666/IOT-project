Software that provides an infrastructure to save information for various IOT devices. The software provides for companies the possibility to register products and IOT devices and receive information about them, such as whether there is a malfunction in the device.

This is a study project designed to connect a number of different subjects I studied and includes:design pattern, handling
requests from users in different communication protocols, work with JSON, saving data in DB (both MySQL and
mongoDB)
